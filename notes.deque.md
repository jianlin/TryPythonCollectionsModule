## deque

pronounced "deck"

like a doubly linked list

there is the append, and appendleft...

and then there is pop, but no push...
and then there is popleft

so...

## JavaScript:

    push
    pop
    unshift
    shift

## Python is

    append
    pop
    appendleft
    popleft

kind of strange

## How to remember...

JavaScript, right hand side is push and pop.
Left hand side is shift, unshift

Python... right hand side is append and pop, not push and pop.
now left hand side is just the right hand side but add the word "left" to it...

Think: array append and stack pop: AA and SP.  Left hand side is just the ___ + "left"
